This is an e-commerce site built with React, Redux, GraphQL and Firebase.  It also uses Stripe as a payment platform.  This is a full stack application and makes use of SASS style sheets.  Each component has its own SASS sheet for easy updating and scaling. The sign-in method with Google or Facebook is implemented using Firebase.  I'm also using Firestore to store customer data.



To start the app:

'yarn start'
